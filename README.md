4. Implement Insertion [ Done ], Selection [ Done ], Bubble [ Done ], Shell, Merge, Quick Sort algorithms.

   * Each algorithm in separate template function.

5. Sort the array of studentsâ€™ objects with each of the previous algorithms.
   * Sort the data one time by Name and another time by GPA.

6. Calculate the running time of each algorithm for each array.

7. The output will be two files, SortedByGPA.txt and SortedByName.txt. Each file contains:
   * Algorithm name.
   * Number of comparisons.
   * Running Time.
   * Sorted Student Elements.
